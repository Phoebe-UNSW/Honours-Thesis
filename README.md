# Honours-Thesis
Code for my Engineering Undergraduate Honours Thesis researching into the crater matching and pose estimation aspects of Lunar satellite crater-based navigation systems under the supervision of Dr Yang Yang.

This repository consists of the most update model created. Titled ThesisB_Model2.ipynb.

The Initial Code Files contain all of initial iterations of the model stages before they were implemented into ThesisB_Model2.ipynb.

This model draws from the HALO propogator tool for satellite trajectory and position which can be found here: https://github.com/Quent2G/High-precision-Analyser-of-Lunar-Orbits
